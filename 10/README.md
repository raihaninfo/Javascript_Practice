OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "Object", which can contain data, in the form of fields(often known as attributes), and code, in the form procedures (often known as methods). [Source 0 Wikipedia]

# How to Think Everything as An Object.
Everything which Takes Multiple Properties to Describe is an Object
## Example -
    parson {
            Name: "something",
            Status: "something",
            Education: "something",
            Address: "something",
            Age: 21
        }

# What is Class in OOP.
Class is Just a factory to create multiple Object without code Duplication.
