# Chapter Ten: OOP in javascript (Object Oriented Programming)

OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "Object", which can contain data, in the form of fields(often known as attributes), and code, in the form procedures (often known as methods). [Source 0 Wikipedia]

# How to Think Everything as An Object.

Everything which Takes Multiple Properties to Describe is an Object

## Example -

    parson {
            Name: "something",
            Status: "something",
            Education: "something",
            Address: "something",
            Age: 21
        }

# What is Class in OOP.

Class is Just a factory to create multiple Object without code Duplication.

## Object Oriented is just a Theory.

### OOP Stands on Four Main Pillar.

1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

## What is Abstraction ?

- Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object oriented programming (OOP) languages. Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity.

## What is Encapsulation ?

- Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of bundiling data and methods that work on that data within one unit.

## What is Inheritance ?

- Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. it is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.

## What is Polymorphism ?
